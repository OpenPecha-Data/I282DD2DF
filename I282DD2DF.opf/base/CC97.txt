A Profound and Concise Guru Yoga
Trikāya master with nine-fold lineage, 1 and sovereign
Of yidams, countless peaceful-wrathful ones, and ḍākinīs,
Lord Vajradhara, glorious protector of the maṇḍala,
From the depths of my heart I go to you for refuge— Please listen with love and compassion!
To rescue all beings from the ocean of saṃsāra’s three realms,
And lead them swiftly to unsurpassed, great awakening,
I will immerse myself in the blessings of guru yoga
And continuously cultivate bodhicitta, the awakened heart!
Ah! The unceasing expression of natural mind, empty yet clear,
Is the glorious guru, who appears in every possible way.
You rest upon my crown, on a lion throne, lotus, sun and moon—
Supreme remembrance, Lord Sangyé Dorjé Tsal.
Your face is ruddy white, fiercely smiling, as you take on a yogi’s appearance,
Wearing a red cloak and an upper robe of unblemished white.
Your head is adorned by a lotus-petalled crown,
And both hands, means and wisdom, are in mudrās of generosity and equipoise.
They hold a vajra and bell, symbolizing unity.
You sit majestically in the revelling pose as the experience of empty-bliss blazes.
Within spheres of rainbow light that fill the sky in all directions,
A boundless ocean of the three roots gather like clouds.
You, guru, are the quintessence of infinite sources of refuge;
Of this I am certain, and in this I have total trust.
With heartfelt devotion and longing I call upon you—
Please grant the four empowerments and bestow your blessings!
oṃ āḥ buddha vajra hūṃ
The guru melts into light, dissolves into me, mind and wisdom merge—
Undistracted and free from effort, this is the great perfection.
The great bliss of all the buddha’s wisdom vastness,
Glorious Vajrasattva, may I realize you!
